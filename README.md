The purpose of this file is to 
1. Get us accustomed to gethub
2. allow us to get somewhat of an undertsand on how to use this coding language
3. answer the 3 questions about the rigid pendulum problem we went over in class

#### Question 1:  How do you expect the rigid pendulum will respond if the frequency of the drive is much higher or much lower than the natural frequency of the pendulum (for small oscillations) and the amplitude is small compared to the size of the pendulum?

##### Answer: When the driving freqeuncy is lower than the pendulums natural frequency the the pendulumn can _almost_ follow the drive in phase. This would result in small oscillations. However, if the driving frequency was higher than the natuaral frequency the pendulum would show some small movement, but not as much.  

#### Question 2: If the pendulum is slightly displaced from equilibrium and the pivot point moves down abruptly, what will happen to the pendulum's displacement angle?

##### Answer: When the pivot drops the pendulum is in free fall with the pivot for a brief moment. So its angular displacement wont change much at first. However, after the drop the pivots new position will be lower which **increases** the pendulumns length. This will cause the pendulumns displacment angle to decrease.

#### Qustion 3: If we start the pendulum oriented above its pivot point, at its unstable equilibrium angle, if the pivot point moves down as the pendulum begins to fall, what is your expectation of the behavior? 

##### Answer: The drop in the pivot point will increase the length of the pendulum which makes it less stable. It will then swing down into its downward equilibrium position.
